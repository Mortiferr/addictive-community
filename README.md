## Development: How does the Addictive Community's framework works? ##

As a .NET/C# and a PHP programmer, I've tried to get the best of both worlds: the simplicity of ASP.NET WebForms/MVC and the flexibility of PHP. So, there is just a few points that really matter:

* There is a "templates" folder, where the Views, CSS files and images are stored. Inside it we have folders for skins, all under the same controller. So, we can have `templates/darkskin/default.tpl.php` and `templates/lightskin/default.tpl.php`, both controlled by `controller/default.php`.
* There is a "controller" folder, where Controllers (duh) are stored. The file name of a Controller must be the same as the View's file name with `.tpl` added to it. E.g.: `template/lightskin/mypage.tpl.php` and `controller/mypage.php`. And that's all!
* If there is a `templates/.../file.tpl.php` and `controller/file.php`, it can be accessed by the address: `index.php?module=file`. Voil√°! Your page must be shown on the screen! ;)
