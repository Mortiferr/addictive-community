## Development: How does the Addictive Community's framework works? ##

As a .NET/C# and a PHP programmer, I've tried to get the best of both worlds: the simplicity of ASP.NET WebForms/MVC and the flexibility of PHP. I wrote this framework from scratch and it is based on MVC pattern, but just "based on", because it is not an actual MVC. There is no "model" layer. All database access, queries and data formatting is done inside the controller layer. So, there is just a controller and a view layer (which I called "templates"). So, there is just a few points that really matter:

* There is a "templates" folder, where the Views, CSS files and images are stored. Inside it we have folders for skins, all under the same controller. So, we can have `templates/darkskin/default.tpl.php` and `templates/lightskin/default.tpl.php`, both controlled by `controller/default.php`.
* There is a "controller" folder, where Controllers (duh) are stored. The file name of a Controller must be the same as the View's file name with `.tpl` added to it. E.g.: `template/lightskin/default.tpl.php` and `controller/default.php`. And that's all!
* If there is a `templates/.../file.tpl.php` and `controller/file.php`, it can be accessed by the address: `index.php?module=file`. Voil√°! Your page must be shown on the screen! ;)

The "kernel" folder is probably the most untouchable folder: the main core files, classes and functions to keep the system running fine. There is not too much to be done in these files, even if you intend to create plug-ins and extensions for Addictive Community.
